Randomization Microservice

This python microservice is part of the adaptive learnig as a service architecture to transform the platform orthografietrainer.net towards adaptivity.
It contains the randomization algorithm and the definiton of the intervention groups. Each user who takes part of the experiment is assigned to one group. 
A user always stays in the same group. 
The platform calls the randomization microservice api after the user starts with a new exercise.
